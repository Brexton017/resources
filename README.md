# Resource List

## Get Involved!

From [Stacks Governance Update #1 - 4 March, 2020](https://github.com/stacksgov/updates/blob/master/updates/20200304-update-001.md):

> Stacks governance is a community-run initiative! As such, it cannot work without your help, and without the input of as many community members as possible. You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the initiative. The #governance working group channel on [Blockstack Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ny6wGkx) is a great place to begin getting involved, as many community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [governance category](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/governance) on the Blockstack Community Forum which need your input.

## Governance Calls

See [Governance Calls](calls/) for more information about past governance community and engineering calls, including:
- agendas
- video recordings
- notes
- additional resource links

## Governance Research

See [Governance Research](research/) for websites, articles, videos, and other items used as a reference while working on this initiative.

## Governance Survey

In Q2 2020 the community conducted a governance survey, inspired by a [similar survey](https://medium.com/coinmonks/ethereum-governance-survey-results-c67c11695f2a) conducted in the Ethereum community in 2019.

See [Governance Survey](survey/) for the archived survey results and analyses.

## Stakeholder Interviews

In Q1 2020 Lane Rettig conducted one-on-one interviews with stakeholders about governance as part of a "listening campaign".

See [Interview Notes](interviews/) for the interview template and notes from each of the one-on-one interviews.
