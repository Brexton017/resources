## Stacks Governance

### Get Involved!

From [Stacks Governance Update #1 - 4 March, 2020](https://github.com/stacksgov/updates/blob/master/updates/20200304-update-001.md):

> Stacks governance is a community-run initiative! As such, it cannot work without your help, and without the input of as many community members as possible. You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the initiative. The #governance working group channel on [Blockstack Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ny6wGkx) is a great place to begin getting involved, as many community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [governance category](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/governance) on the Blockstack Community Forum which need your input.

### Governance Calls

See [Governance Calls](calls/README.md) for resources related to governance calls.

### Governance Survey

In Q2 2020 we conducted a governance survey, inspired by a [similar survey](https://medium.com/coinmonks/ethereum-governance-survey-results-c67c11695f2a) conducted in the Ethereum community in 2019. Learn more about the survey, the goals of the survey, and how to contribute in [this forum thread](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/community-governance-survey/10387) or in [this Github issue](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues/1). You can view the [archived survey results](survey/).
