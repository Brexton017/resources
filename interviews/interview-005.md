*   What’s your role?
    *   Officially, maintainer of Android SDK, so my role is technical
        *   (we have an iOS SDK but Apple is pushing back on it, so the future is unclear)
    *   I’m an interested follower
    *   Technical developer, evangelist, community manager
    *   And exploring technologies, so I try to make prototypes more than real projects
        *   Where’s the line between the two?
        *   I don’t pursue the go to market, I don’t have a team, no one to run campaigns, no marketing or customer service
    *   I have a freelance contract with PBC
    *   Got involved when it was OneName.com, I had registered a name, when they made the change to Blockstack I rediscovered it, and the Android SDK, began contributing to it, invited them to sponsor an Android conference, from there on we had a conversation about the Android part
    *   What interested me was the App Mining program
    *   I was looking at the EOS worker proposal fund, found it interesting as an idea for helping develop apps but it didn’t really work out
*   What do you think about App Mining?
    *   I don’t really have a solution
    *   What went wrong? At the end, PBC didn’t take enough lead to tackle the problems
    *   They said they received pushback from some developers on certain rules even though it was clear that the rules are not in support of the goals
    *   They could’ve said, okay, these are the rules but we’ll break them because it’s going the wrong direction
    *   It’s a centralized decision but you need some mechanism to protect your community, that didn’t really happen
    *   Q: What could that mechanism look like?
        *   Should be a third party that could oversee the progress
        *   I don’t think there’s anything comparable out there
        *   There’s government, big companies, citizens, but none of these could solve the problem
            *   The solution would be to have some collective mechanism, but that’s probably complicated
            *   I had a conversation about this recently, in the context of civic tech, about identity
        *   At the moment I can’t say, e.g., “let the police solve it"
        *   Users cannot solve it because they’re not knowledgeable, not educated enough, need education to solve the problem - probably only a subset of people could do the task
    *   Q: Okay, so what could/should we be doing?
        *   Limit the expectation of decentralization a bit, so that there has to be some entity that make decisions: rather than making decisions as a group, there’s an entity that follows rules that everyone in the group agrees on
        *   Just in order to keep everything functioning, and a bit more efficient
        *   Re: a Foundation, I think it’s a good approach
            *   you say, everyone agrees on these fundamental ideas, that the Foundation describes
            *   if you disagree you’re free to fork the project and do something else
            *   Foundation could be the entity making decisions
            *   I see the Foundation as bigger than App Mining
    *   Q: What _did_ go well?
        *   It’s important to find a solution to how developers can be paid for creating UIs for user data
        *   I’d like to see a shift from the _developer_ as the owner of the app/project, it should be more open so everyone, user, designer, etc. can build the app in a collaborative way
        *   For decentralized apps it’s important
        *   next step: enabling customization so it’s easy to fork an app, to have user-specific app, so that even the users themselves can adapt the app
        *   As a community, as all stakeholders that have an interest in the app - app “framework” for this use case - then everyone can push and pull a bit and have what they really want
        *   I’m in discussion with mathematician/philosopher, who has an interesting approach to this - it’s about exchanging value, how you evaluate the contribution you’re doing, everyone can switch roles
        *   I’m also following the Holochain app system, valueflo.ws, they describe this approach also in a similar way, Holo-REA project is the tech implementation, [valueflo.ws](https://valueflo.ws/) is the more theoretical approach
    *   We didn’t really manage to collaborate on the data collections but that’s also something that Stacks 2.0 impacted and then it wasn’t high priority anymore - App Mining stopped when collections topic came up (data structures, standards)
        *   Content provider on Android: brings this into web world, and cross-platform, this is very comparable
        *   What I did for the calendar, I tried to show how this can work together (see [OI Calendar](http://www.openintents.org/calendar/))
*   What’s the role of the Foundation?
    *   In general, oversee the development of the project
    *   Try to steer the community as well, see what they want, where everyone is going
        *   By majority, follow this track
        *   Is majority the right metric?
            *   In general, yes.
            *   On second thought, maybe not?
            *   If you get lots of people onboarded to the community that have different goals, you shouldn’t follow them.
    *   Anything else?
        *   Protect the values of the community, “policing"
            *   It should at least point out that certain activities are not aligned with the goals/principles
            *   Then maybe suggest actions or enforce them if agreed this should happen
*   Do we want a Foundation in the first place?
    *   I don’t see any other options
    *   Do we need a legal entity in the first place?
    *   For App Mining treasury, yes, I think we need a legal entity that can make contracts with the miners
        *   Q: We can’t use smart contracts for this?
        *   It’s just a tool, not a legal entity. You’re using them in order to execute a legal contract in a more efficient way.
        *   I don’t see that the smart contract can be a legal entity?
    *   In general I like the co-op concept, I don’t know how it differs from a foundation
        *   With co-op you’d define community more strictly
        *   You become part of co-op, same as joining the community. If you’re a “member” of the Foundation, is this the same?
*   Who is a stakeholder/citizen/who do we listen to?
    *   It should be based on reputation
    *   But I don’t really have a good understanding of all the possibilities or mechanisms
    *   Even a user of an app, or holder of identity, is a stakeholder
    *   (STX token holders, developers)
    *   If you have STX tokens but “you don’t really care” then you’re not really part of the community
    *   "Holding tokens per se does not make you a stakeholder” even though it’s a financial investment
    *   Anyone else you would exclude?
        *   Big tech companies
        *   Nothing else comes to mind, haven’t thought about it much
*   What are the mission/vision/values of this community/project?
    *   Very strong on user-owned identity, esp. in contrast to [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/): user can have multiple identities and it’s lessa about KYC, can use different identities for different purposes
        *   Stacks 2.0 is orthogonal, not directly related to identity, but it’s a tool to make identity possible
        *   Could be used for anything, it’s very general, not specifically pushing on identity
    *   Data ownership
    *   Data security, less dependency on one service provider, decentralization of data
        *   Muneeb says data is replicated but in reality it’s not
            *   If you write to Gaia you can define/it is defined that the data is at several locations but at the moment it’s at just one location the user has defined
    *   Privacy - is or should be important
        *   Current solution not as private as it could be - we could emphasize this more
        *   It’s important to clarify where Blockstack as a project stands on this: At the moment some people say it’s private, some say it’s not
*   What does governance mean to you?
    *   A set of rules that describes how rules can be changed
    *   So that it’s clear what you want to do, also includes how you can change the rules if you need - in a very abstract way
    *   It’s easy to say but hard to realize
*   What does _good_ governance mean to you?
    *   Everyone has the possibility to share their opinion
    *   Also push back if it’s not in the interest of the majority, however we define that
    *   Transparency is very important: if you’re pushing back, everyone knows the reasons, we agree on it
*   How do we do this in Blockstack?
    *   App Mining: you could say, this app won’t receive rewards because of these rules, because we think it does not follow this interest so we cut off this app
        *   Q: Who is the “we”?
        *   The “we” that makes the decision.
        *   It could be a good idea to split and localize the task, so that you have smaller responsibility and therefore less important if you make wrong decisions
        *   Q: What could that look like in App Mining?
            *   I proposed we split the rewards into different data structures, or more generally different use cases
            *   Each use case has its own team or governance, working group that distributes the rewards for the apps that fall into this category
            *   So maybe that can be more generalized as well: split task, money into smaller pieces, smaller pots of money, give more people responsibility
            *   Does it work in the real world?
            *   Big companies grow and eat everyone up
            *   Cities, e.g. taking action on climate change, they can also achieve things
    *   Does it scale? Maybe not. So we have to think about that as well.
    *   Scalability for these rules is important.
*   How do you get legitimacy/confidence/trust?
    *   Transparency is the most important
    *   Diversity so that we have good representation of different opinions
    *   Q: Defined how? If humans, then different gender, cultural background, education, opinions
    *   The results matter too - if you have a history of good results, you have more trust. For this it’s important to have transparency so people can see what you have and haven’t achieved.
*   Is decentralization of governance the right goal? Why or why not?
    *   I don’t have a view on how decentralization of governance would work
    *   You have one single set of principles or rules that defines the goals, the foundation, there is only one of these, you cannot decentralize this
    *   If you put this into a smart contract or a DAO then there could be decentralized governance
    *   My understanding is that PBC is not the right entity to do the work for legal reasons
        *   Because they are under US control
        *   Singapore is more reasonable, even if maybe there are more democratic countries
        *   You may want to choose one that’s more aligned with the goals of the Foundation
*   How have things worked in the past?
    *   Not very transparent
    *   Some people gave feedback on the Blockstack project, I didn’t receive any information
    *   I heard several people gave feedback but it didn’t result in any action/feedback/statement, that’s very non-transparent. People left the project, gave reasons why, I heard about these people but there was no discussion/outcome. PBC has the sole decision-making, vision, no one else can influence them.
*   What’s gone well/not so well?
    *   There has been good progress, good development (technology-wise)
    *   Also, the credibility of the project is high in general (even though the price is down)
    *   I hear lots of people who know about Blockstack and say it’s interesting
*   How would you like things to work in the future?
    *   (esp: treasury, protocol)
    *   App Mining is the most important part
    *   No particular thoughts on the protocol - transparency, etc.
*   How do we govern the Foundation? E.g. directors, to whom should it be accountable?
    *   Q: should it be accountable to someone? yes, probably 🙂
    *   It (its governance) should be diverse, accountable to the community, whatever that means - e.g., who is in and out
    *   Divide-and-conquer - I don’t know how this could work but it could be part of the solution
*   What else should I have asked you?
    *   I don’t have a lot of experience
    *   I like the Mozilla Foundation as a credible foundation, what they do, but I don’t know how its governance works
