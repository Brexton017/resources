*   What’s your role in the project/community/ecosystem?
    *   I work for PBC, evangelism + meetups
    *   I still think of myself as a community member, I try to be super transparent about all of our initiatives - this is one piece of feedback we got last year, that things are closed and the community don’t know what’s going on
    *   Being transparent is important to the community but it’s difficult to do because our timeframe is so aggressive 
*   How did you first get involved?
    *   Was familiar with the space since 2017, in 2018 I joined. Background in IT, was working on infrastructure, RedHat. Really boring, nothing revolutionary, nothing to brag about.
    *   I saw a YouTube video of Muneeb and Ryan, then went down the rabbit hole
    *   Joined community, offered to do what I can.
    *   I sent a pitch deck to Patrick - said guys, I want to work for you, don’t know on what, just hire me
    *   After a month he got back to me, but I was already super active. I have a generalist background, not a great dev but I can code, not a great designer but I can design, so I dove in, started to design e.g. posters
    *   I will forever appreciate the opportunity to work on Blockstack
    *   I was reading a lot of Antonoupolous’s stuff, met him face to face, hope he still remembers me
*   What are the mission/vision/values of this community/project?
    *   Mission is to replace every function that PBC has. At the end of the day you don’t want a single entity to have control over the network
    *   Mission of Blockstack is to provide open, free Internet
    *   As a community we need to think of ways that each of us can help replace the functions of PBC
    *   What about values?
        *   I’ve been speaking to a lot of evangelists
        *   They like the fact that we're pushing for privacy, security, digital freedom
        *   They want to contribute to the project for these reasons, even without monetary compensation
    *   What do you mean by evangelist?
        *   We’re trying to revamp it in a way that makes sense
        *   Kind of like brand ambassadors
        *   We didn’t have specific threshold of responsibilities that they can feel accountable for
        *   We have > 100 evangelists, probably around 25-30% that are active, people come and go
        *   We have the OG ones, e.g. Juliet, DanT, now Jason
        *   Blockstack Evangelist means you help move the needle in the ecosystem in some way, community development, joining different working groups, e.g. governance, business model, PoX
*   What does governance mean to you?
    *   This is always a difficult question
    *   "I hate politics, to be honest, I don’t really like the government"
    *   It’s hard!
    *   Right now I think being involved in the decision-making process could help me understand why we should have governance
    *   Right now mostly the decisions are made by PBC, and the community has only a little stake in it
    *   If you’re gonna go back to the first question, what’s Blockstack’s mission? I think governance plays a big role
    *   How you decide on the “open internet” - it’s open, at the end of the day, people can do good or bad stuff, how do you “punish the bad actors”?
    *   One of the best ways for governance is to write up some rules
    *   Like App Mining
*   What do you think about App Mining?
    *   It was a good mechanism, but fell short because there weren’t really any consequences for bad actors
    *   Game theory says there should be!
    *   It was so hard for PBC to make a decision on how to punish bad actors - worried about how the community will feel
    *   May think it’s too centralized, e.g., if a decision is made to kick an actor out of the ecosystem
    *   One way to solve that problem is governance
    *   The community probably felt they’d been heard but none of the proposals were put into action; or, they were, but it was really really slow
        *   Problem in PBC is that there’s not enough bandwidth
    *   There’s no flow: if I propose something what’s the next step? At the end of the day PBC makes the decision to implement or not
    *   For example PBC could have one vote, community one vote, other stakeholders’ entities could have one vote
        *   So e.g. community could override PBC’s opinion
*   What does _good_ governance mean to you?
    *   From a guy who doesn’t really like politics! Can make a decision that will be beneficial for all actors in the ecosystem - everything has pros and cons
    *   Good governance means you offer the best decision that will benefit the most actors in a positive way (i.e., a utilitarian definition of good governance)
    *   What should it not do?
        *   Right now I know that PBC makes most of the decisions
        *   I’ve been listening to the conversation in the governance working group
        *   No concrete model yet for governance
        *   We have ~300k token holders, some are probably whales
        *   Good governance should eliminate the fact that - I don’t like it when whales have so much power over decision making
        *   I don’t like that it’s one token one vote; I prefer "one entity one vote"
        *   At the end of the day, we have self-sovereign identity, so it should be “one identity one vote” - that’s what we stand for
        *   Lane: How do you do that, though? In a decentralized network
            *   If you want to have this “governance utopia” - it’s quite difficult
            *   You need some sort of mechanism
*   How do you get legitimacy/confidence/trust?
    *   Transparency - e.g., if I pay my taxes, I want to know where it goes
        *   E.g., “Why are we building so many roads?”
        *   I want it to be super-transparent
    *   Involve people in decision-making; “inclusivity"
        *   E.g., ask me: “Do we want to build a road?”
*   Is decentralization of governance the right goal? Why or why not?
    *   That’s a tricky question
    *   It’s hard if you just put it all on the community at once
    *   We need organization: community could vote on who should be the governing organization, could also vote it out
        *   I mean any organization! Not just PBC, Foundation, etc.
        *   There could be several, at the same time
        *   There should be different kinds of governing orgs.
        *   In different roles
        *   Once it’s more settled, they could dissolve - e.g., set up mechanism that works for community, e.g. a DAO, if you do this successfully then the governing body has no more reason to exist
        *   I.e., governance that’s as “thin” as possible - everything is automated - that’s utopia for me
    *   At the end of the day you want these microeconomies - it doesn’t really work on the big scale
    *   For me the whole point of this space is decentralization! including of governance
*   Is this the right way to do it (i.e., decentralize governance)?
    *   Foundation could be a great step bc it could remove some of the power from PBC itself
    *   We always talk about the path to decentralization. One of the best ways to do it is to put more association within the network itself before you give it to the community.
    *   Could be a foundation, different entity that has different opinions about the ecosystem
    *   Right now, in terms of timeline, creating a DAO in Q3 or Q4 when mainnet is rolled out - could be good
    *   From community standpoint, educating people on why governance is actually important is also important
    *   Lane talked about community touchpoint - ordinary people often don’t care! How do you get them to care?
    *   We should tell them: “this governance is for you” - this is how things will work if e.g. PBC goes away
    *   I could help you guys organize this - governance workshop sessions - that’s what we’re doing, more virtual workshops - happy to coordinate these throughout the community
    *   Cryptoeconomic governance workshop - could be valuable to the community
    *   That’s also one of the problems of PBC before - we have silos at the moment - trying to break these down bit by bit
*   How have things worked in the past?
    *   I won’t speak as a PBC employee but from my standpoint the decision making process - a lot power in the hands of PBC for entire network - it’s only really in the past few months that we’ve really begun to operate as an open source project
    *   For past four years we operated more as a closed source project
    *   Q: What changed?
        *   We, the team in general, realized that the way to go is to be more open on the things we actually do - to be more involved in the community
        *   We’ve built a community we can lean on
        *   We asked ourselves before - the Ethereum community is really intellectually knowledgeable about everything, have the first-mover advantage, got a lot of people who are willing to experiment
        *   Before we didn’t have smart contracts, was mostly consumer-facing utility products - don’t get much in the community with that
        *   Now, with a token, with smart contracts - a lot more going on in the ecosystem - the community now willing to be more involved
        *   These things have been in the pipeline for a long time, but it just took a long time to roll it out
*   What’s gone well/not so well?
    *   App Mining was a fail
        *   If we had a governance model that let us move specific features forward - e.g., voting mechanisms for reviewers - it would have been so much better
    *   Protocol: Blockstack takes a long time to launch things, tons of R&D involved. If you have a single body that’s doing all the R&D then it’s much more robust. This went well. This is an advantage of having a single body that makes the decision. It’s “less noisy."
        *   Sometimes community gives feedback but there’s no action associated with it
        *   When you want to work with a super fast timetable - you get a comment - not sure what to do with it?
*   Should we try App Mining again?
    *   We were trying to launch the same initiative for community rewards - who will oversee it? Decide if it’s good or not?
    *   Always hard because there will probably be a single decision-making entity to govern it to make it good
    *   If e.g. App Mining was run by a single entity it would’ve been even better - would’ve had more quality apps, as opposed to quantity
    *   With decentralization - you put different kinds of entities on it - if it works then it works perfectly, if not then it doesn’t really work
    *   To be honest the optimum is somewhere in the middle - don’t put entire decision in hands of any one entity
*   How would you like things to work in the future?
    *   If all entities were dissolved - could set up a really nice mechanism to set up “microeconomies” - every person has a stake within the ecosystem
    *   We have certain funds we need to unlock, need e.g. 60% majority of community members to unlock it to proceed
    *   Microeconomies within the Stacks community managing things, no Stacks foundation, no PBC - these entities set up the mechanism, then go away
    *   Certain percentage you need - 300k token holders, maybe we need 51% simple majority, maybe 70%
    *   That’s my vision
*   Where do we draw the line around stakeholders?
    *   There are different stakeholders, e.g., some evangelists don’t own tokens
    *   I’d segregate it within the community: STX holders and non-STX holders
    *   Who goes into the latter? Those who have a Blockstack identity. If you’re super involved but don’t have tokens you probably still have an ID.
        *   Q: What does it cost to generate a new ID?
        *   It’s free but you can pay for a premium ID.
        *   Q: What prevents Sybil attacks here?
        *   That’s a good question. You can’t really do KYC. I don’t have an answer.
    *   Q: Would you explicitly exclude anyone?
        *   Core devs, maybe. Because they’re probably biased when it comes to decision-making. They’re heavily invested. Every core dev. has their own version of utopia but it’s often not the best way to go for the whole community
        *   If they believe in the mission of open internet, they probably want what the people want.
        *   They should share this vision.
*   Who should have a role in protocol governance?
    *   Core devs should only have a say on the protocol because they know best
    *   For ecosystem-wide decision making that doesn’t involve core protocol - core devs shouldn’t be involved in it
    *   Two tiers of governance: core protocol, then everything else as a second tier
*   How do we govern the Foundation? E.g. directors, to whom should it be accountable?
    *   I’m heavily involved in the community.
    *   You have different kinds of working group - one from each working group should be on the board - then one person from community (not in working group), “average Joe."
    *   Also, someone from PBC.
    *   That’s a nice way to set it up.
    *   Then you know what’s going on with different working groups - unites everything - also core protocol
    *   Q: Does this capture everything necessary? All the necessary expertise?
        *   I’d remove the “average Joe.” The community should have some sort of vote on how to move forward. Maybe the STX holders.
    *   What are we funding? if I know what we’re funding then I could give a more concrete answer on who should run the foundation.
        *   This is a tricky question too
        *   I see Blockstack more as infrastructure
        *   I don’t think apps should be funded
        *   You should invest in good dev tools to create a really nice OSS infra., without dev tools you can’t make nice apps
        *   The Foundation should not fund apps, it should fund tools to make apps
        *   Fund the people who will build the tools around it, including the protocol itself
*   Any final thoughts?
    *   I never talked about governance before, I really enjoyed this!
    *   I’m excited about this and how it will move forward!
