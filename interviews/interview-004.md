*   What’s your role in the project/community/ecosystem?
    *   I stumbled upon the community and been struggling with trying to find my goal
    *   I see a vision I agree with, that aligns with my values
    *   Been trying to find out where I fit in the ecosystem: governance, biz models, mining
    *   Governance, biz models both big subjects. The way everything fits together is what I’m thinking about. There’s some overlap between these groups. I want to help consolidate this info, make sure we’re working under one Code of Conduct.
    *   For this month, I had some extra time, and it’s perfect timing, but on a month by month basis I’m still trying to decide how much time I can allocate. For now this is a passion project/hobbyist project for me. But I’m trying to figure out how to integrate my business ideas into this ecosystem.
    *   I want to do this in a way that truly gives back. Spent years working with only open source applications. Now it’s time to teach others how to do that, and to “be in touch with your software.” Blockstack is all about user-owned internet.
*   What are the values of this community/project?
    *   Digital rights, privacy, “user-owned” concept: taking things out of the hands of large companies, people that censor. This is a noble cause. But a large part of the community is focused on those items.
    *   A lot of those values are based on core values as a person, e.g., love and compassion - how do people manifest that through software or in this community?
    *   What personal values come out of it? Collaboration. We’re seeing that too: wanting to see each other’s successes. “We should always raise others to our level so that we can break through to the next.” Working together we really want to honor each other - finding ways to establish consensus, share what’s worked and what hasn’t. Answers a lot of questions people have personally about - how do you feel when you create an app? Do you feel stifled on the market? Answers a lot about how people feel about larger corporate take over of the Internet.
    *   Any normal user I’ve talked to - I had 70 clients for five years, all quite different - "we all make choices because we don’t think we have another option. A lot of us are here to develop the other option, we just don’t quite know how."
    *   That’s fine! We have some amazing resources. In dev side, academic knowledge - very impressive, almost intimidating! But I know I can play a part - just trying to figure out what it is.
    *   You and PBC are taking a hands off approach, trying to establish those boundaries, we’re in a transition phase, it will take some time to figure out.
    *   “If you gave me six hours to chop down a tree I’d spend the first four sharpening my axe.” We’re in this phase now.
    *   In the next step we’re going to build the ability to answer these questions. Up to now PBC has handled things. That makes sense looking at the background but it’s hard to see people making decisions when you’re not part of it but you’re supposed to be.
    *   It’s about vulnerability - gives us the ability to connect - but the first step is hard, like jumping off the high dive.
*   What does governance mean to you?
    *   "Structure in which we make decisions"
    *   Foundation, ecosystem, questions asked - what are we responsible for? A, B, C, D - if we want to add “E” - how do we as a group come to consensus on that?
    *   Decision-making with regard to resources - funding, App Mining, etc.
    *   [Governance] is our outlet for allowing [the community] to be a part of it
*   What does (good) governance mean to you?
    *   "Fair and equal rights."
    *   Everyone’s biggest concern in any type of decentralized governance system seems to be one large party being able to affect the votes/take over the system.
    *   We’re all trying to find ways to make sure votes are fair, e.g., quadratic voting - that’s a cool idea, sounds like it could help!
    *   Finding that balance so it’s never completely controlled by one actor, even if behind multiple parties.
    *   Transparency. Being able to take part in, contribute to, see progress of the project out in the open.
*   How do you get legitimacy/confidence/trust?
    *   Trust. Legitimacy and trust play into each other.
    *   Big theme coming from the crypto community and digital privacy rights is how to build things [without trust] - that’s the big question - how to build it in such a way so that we don’t have to have that level of trust?
    *   Trust comes from relationships - build relationships w/each other, a community - we are vulnerable - these relationships of trust are very important.
    *   But also caution on trust being required in the first place, because that’s where it becomes a grey area. Building up trust, community values, when I contribute it gets included, when I vote my vote counts.
    *   How do you make something acceptable, without requirement?
        *   It should be voluntary
    *   We’re reaching an interesting “age” in our democracy - a lot of places [historically] didn’t make it much further.
    *   People have lost touch with the government process. Could we enable a lot of term limits? Cycle through people faster. Anyone I talk to in my generation, and the ones above and below, they don’t think they can have an impact anymore. Once you lose this "want to do something” you’re not even contributing anymore - it’s really sad.
    *   How many people are involved today vs. how many will be here in six months, or 5-10 yrs? How have BTC/ETH/other projects done this/what are the trends? Do people stay involved for the long term?
*   Is decentralization of governance the right goal? Why or why not? Is this the right way to do it?
    *   Balaji made a case for some centralization making sense.
    *   I don’t have a strong opinion either way - I’m learning from past examples
    *   At the end of the day someone has to be responsible
    *   In a centralized system we make it the way it operates
    *   It’s a hard question
    *   Like doing recursive programming, you have to wrap your head around it - it’s an interesting goal, how do we make it work the way we want?
    *   Don’t have a strong feeling as long as it held the values and structure I think makes sense
    *   Some of the team values quick action, some value long-term thinking, you need both
    *   "Two keys to launch the nuke” - multisig wallets are an interesting topic. Even with Quadratic Voting, how could there be multiple requirements to make something pass?
    *   I think hybrid makes sense - determining which pieces make sense for each part of the structure
    *   [Zcash “multisig” on brand](https://electriccoin.co/blog/electric-coin-co-donates-zcash-trademark-to-zcash-foundation/) - does everything need to go through this system? What happens in the case of stalemate?
    *   Ideally it works well. If there’s a major issue then that has some underlying cause as well.
    *   I’d like to extract the “why” from each link that’s been shared in the chat/on the resources - still trying to figure out how to do this.
    *   We have a great community but it’s becoming quite time consuming - I feel the stress - no one has said anything yet, e.g., I have calls Mon-Wed-Fri every week through May. I’m okay with that but don’t know how others can adjust.
    *   As a community member, if I can take on a small clear project, like with keeping resources updated, I’d be okay with that, just want to clearly define it so I know I can achieve it.
        *   My thought: can we set up a delegative/representative system to address this?
        *   The Foundation of course has to follow the legal charter in the jurisdiction in which it’s formed, but what rights will be given to it?
*   How have things worked in the past?
    *   Biggest complaint is what was brought to light on the governance working group call today: governance very centralized in the hands of PBC.
    *   Stacks 2.0 not done yet, when it’s launched the intention is to hand it off and get things going from there.
    *   Doing fine but it’s about to change - this is on the horizon and coming on fast.
    *   Things are centralized now but it has to start somewhere.
    *   Thinking about how to move forward is why I want to be a part of this. If I want to bring my business operations under the Blockstack umbrella I need to make sure my core values are upheld in community and the Foundation.
*   What’s gone well/not so well?
    *   Biggest challenges: communication, education. Both are already being worked on, progressing towards better solutions.
    *   Communication - a lot of places to look for a lot of things - I want to keep driving things back towards GitHub, use it as the core, e.g., forum discussion. Action items should become GitHub issues.
    *   Not everyone has received that message yet.
    *   It’s messy, the way GTD tools like Trello that get tasks out of our head are the best tools.
    *   When you look at the [PM repository](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm) you don’t immediately see the Projects tab - or that it’s related to issues. That’s where some people are, unless they’ve been using GitHub for a long time.
    *   Want to share the blog post I wrote - get people to think through how that process works. We can make more simple instructions.
*   Is this the right way to do it?
    *   The “multisig” idea is more appealing to me, and to a lot of people that want to be a part of the process or have a voice, whether through the Foundation or a different structure.
    *   As long as the Foundation is in alignment with community, you can have it, and Foundation, and other pieces down the road.
    *   Maybe there could be a third?
    *   Wouldn’t necessarily change this 
    *   At a high level I agree with this structure. Based on my complete inexperience :)
*   How would you like things to work in the future?
    *   PBC currently embraces this, and it’s something we want to consider part of governance: ability to allow for change. Everything is built on top of BTC but if we had to it could be changed to something else.
    *   I’d suggest same for structure. Start with Foundation and PBC, see how it goes, but how do we make it so that it could be changed without a huge impact on the governance initiative itself?
    *   How do you “refactor” governance / what “API” do you build around it?
    *   This is the thing that’s missing from real world governance now - the ability to refactor.
    *   That’s where you’d see soft and hard forks.
    *   Embrace change/chaos.
        *   How do you do this?
        *   Offhand, not sure, but I can look into this more.
    *   Biz models group: we discussed “thinking outside of the dapp.” You want to make one that does shared Google Docs? Why not make an engine for people to create something that allows for shared Google Docs, i.e., one layer higher of abstraction.
*   Where do we draw the line around Stakeholders?
    *   There’s a list of roles in the survey. “I’m in the more inclusive camp. The more people included the better. But I don’t know what that does in terms of complexity."
    *   Want to balance this: being able to make decisions vs. no one making one.
    *   It would be easier for me to comment on each of the stakeholder positions, submit others if I think of them.
    *   I tick many boxes: I work in dev, design, user, evangelist, miner, community member, business, investor in future.
    *   I wonder how many people have multiple identifications vs. identify more deeply with one.
    *   Anyone who should be excluded?
        *   No - good to be inclusive
        *   I plan to run a node and try mining, not for financial stake
        *   I’d go into research on why Ethereum and other communities don’t like miners, make a decision from there
*   Who should have a role in protocol governance?
    *   Difficulty here is education. Don’t mind everyone having a voice/stake but you want people to know what they’re talking about.
    *   These challenges highlight where problems can be fixed. If we can’t ELI5 then maybe we can improve.
    *   I want to lean towards inclusive but I see some challenges given the technical nature.
    *   Some of this has come up in multiple meetings - it’s highly technical, and hard to get up to speed.
    *   How do you create small bands of people together, e.g., a guild that upholds some set of values - do some KYC, this is who I am - and the guilds works together on an open source project - have their dapps, and contribute to Blockstack stuff.
    *   How do we encourage this type of participation - you get access to a pool or a “PM” type role - build some model around that thought
    *   I wonder if that kind of allegiance would play into making decisions or being able to vote
    *   It’s a way to put group affiliations out in the open, which should help with undercover group associations trying to attack the network
    *   Tying it into a pooling and stacking is a fun idea
*   What about App Mining?
    *   I joined towards the end of it, although it was one of the first things that drew me in
    *   The idea that I could make money developing something was attractive
    *   It was a strong draw but it brought on a bunch of people with ideas that I think may not work long-term
    *   I love the idea of hackathons, of generating new ideas, but if they’re just ideas that no one is maintaining, what value are they adding to the ecosystem? Other than just sharing codebase
    *   I saw [Muneeb’s comment on the future](https://blog.blockstack.org/the-next-phase-of-app-mining/), and challenges, and I agree with him
    *   Challenges on what the incentivization did
    *   We had some early notification on what Larry was up to with New Internet Labs (NIL) - what if you made a guild requirement open source, or something that had to be verified and checked off?
    *   I don’t want to duplicate any of the efforts done by NIL but I love the idea of analyzing something against a set of core values
    *   If it was a system that made sense as part of the ecosystem, it could be something the Foundation could make canonical, you could spin up your own app chain but have to qualify to be on the canonical list
    *   What we’re learning in decentralization in governance applies to apps and biz models and everything else - we’re hacking the way things work originally 
*   How do we govern the Foundation? E.g. directors, to whom should it be accountable?
    *   I’m looking forward to watching this conversation play out
    *   Need to honor what the community wants
    *   Hardest thing to accept is that it has to be a Singapore native, has to be some minimum number of people
    *   Without that trust, people are starting to ask - where are we going?
    *   What can a member do in the Foundation? Directors vs. community leaders - don’t know this yet, don’t know structure yet.
    *   I’m the guy who sits in the back and takes notes and makes a decision later
*   What else should I have asked you?
    *   I think we covered more than enough.
    *   Feel like we’re working on the same page here.
    *   I’m trying to do the same: hearing the community’s opinion rather than just sharing my own - I’m more interested in this collaborative nature.
    *   Silence on these calls is normal at this stage - and it means consensus on some level - “I agree and I have nothing to add."
    *   “Silence is one of the most beautiful tools we have."
