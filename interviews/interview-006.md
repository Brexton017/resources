*   What’s your role?
    *   I think I ticked almost all of the boxes in the survey. I feel like I’m part of the community, evangelist, app developer, and I have an opinion on a lot of things. I’m all over the place.
    *   I’m a full-time hobbyist.
*   How did you get involved?
    *   I was looking at Ethereum and ran across Muneeb’s post - I’ve told this story in the community 1000 times - he had a post in 2016 about [three things Ethereum would have need to work on](https://medium.com/@muneeb/the-road-ahead-for-ethereum-b5b090bcd1a) - it resonated with me
    *   Started hanging out in their Slack channel, chatting with Patrick, etc. so it went from there
    *   Way back in 97-99 I was one of the guys outside of libraries handing out Linux CDs, I’ve always been active in the open source community
    *   Also part of Google developer groups
    *   I was a Ubuntu Florida local community lead for a while
    *   I’ve always been organizing open source community groups, meetings, etc.
    *   In 2009 I dropped out of Ubuntu, did the Google thing for a few years, then I wasn’t doing anything, found Blockstack, it resonated with me, the ethos, the fact that I didn’t see Muneeb screaming about how good it is, and instead I saw core engineers focused on making it good
    *   I remember seeing other projects that would complete an ICO, then the project lead went on a world tour - I was like, you just raised money and you should be working!
*   What’s the same or different with the other open source projects you’ve contributed to?
    *   Early Linux stuff - was literally people in IRC coordinating. There was no hackathons, no one handing out swag. That was very grassroots.
    *   Ubuntu, Mark Shuttleworth brought $1B in, had big dev conferences in the community. They paid for a large number of sponsorships, brought us to Barcelona for big dev conferences. This was the first time I saw a lot of money in a community. It was good and bad. When they stopped that, the community bottomed out. People were there “for the free stuff” - as compared to the early days, when we handed out Slackware CDs because we cared about the project
    *   Google open source stuff - not just Android, it was all the Google tech - had a lot of money, better organized.
    *   Ubuntu had a community council that made decisions, did dispute resolution, etc.
        *   This was good and bad
        *   Ended up being a "buddy system”, in my opinion - it was the core people that had started, rotated among a small group of core people. As the community exploded the governance and leadership still remained with those core people, there was no influx. I was part of the core community, I just looked around and thought, why aren’t we talking to all these new people?
    *   Google was much more organized - that’s something I’ve brought to the community here - “we’re introducing Dart in two months, here are tutorials, etc.” - we don’t get that with Blockstack, that’s a hard one to deal with
    *   Bringing money to the table, trying to grow community by paying people, this rubs me the wrong way
    *   Comparing to the Blockstack community, there are similarities and differences. There are some core people who are definitely here for the principles, which reminds me of early Linux days. One of my core questions  is, are you here for the principles or for the money? This affects how much I trust you to do the right thing.
    *   Q: How do you tell?
        *   It’s not always obvious, don’t always do a good job, I try to give you the benefit of the doubt, but if your first question is about money then, to me, it’s obvious
        *   If devs come into Discord and ask questions I try to help
        *   I definitely form opinions about people - based on things I see them doing or not doing
        *   I’m trying to better about not judging
*   What are the mission/vision/values of this community/project?
    *   Blockstack’s mission is to create a new internet that enables users to be in control of their own data. Re-enabling privacy.
    *   Privacy as core value? Yes, I’d say that.
        *   This does motivate me to an extent - privacy is important
        *   But also the data sovereignty. I’ve never been a fan of vendor lock-in, walled gardens, data silos.
        *   My tagline in my email is: “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of Open Standards."
    *   Data ownership & portability as well
    *   Open source nature of it - if this were happening in the Hadera Hashgraph kind of way I don’t think I’d be as on board
    *   Or even Google with Android - "they just throw the open source stuff over the wall every few months"
*   App Mining
    *   I thought it was terrible but I wanted to give it time
    *   My issue is basically that when we started it we did experiments, there were ten of us that had been around in the community from before App Mining. We came up with some apps, they definitely weren’t great, but the people were there for the principle.
    *   Justin Hunter’s Graphite was the best app out there. We had Justin as the spokesperson for Blockstack apps, he’s well spoken, he thinks things through, had a decent app.
    *   Prabhaav, wrote [Stealthy](https://www.stealthy.im/), it was limited, but he was there for the principle, decentralized messaging
    *   We went from Graphite and Stealthy, to apps like EasyGif, being a representation of Blockstack’s “best”.
    *   If you look at what happened, you had these great spokespeople, good developers, who if they had more money could’ve made their apps much better. This was totally derailed by apps that were super simple and created by developers who mostly didn’t really care for Blockstack’s principles.
    *   App Mining turned out to be a good idea but it wasn’t responsive enough, when we saw issues they weren’t addressed immediately
    *   I take the “mining” metaphor a little more literally in the sense that if you’re mining on a blockchain and you attack it you’re immediately penalized - by slashing or some other penalty - blockchain  protocols do this. App Mining did not.
    *   We saw calculator-type apps trying to win and people buying Twitter activity and Product Hunt upvotes, people cheating the system, with no penalty.
    *   When Justin, Prabhaav began to drop in rankings compared to apps by people who didn’t really care, they moved on - to Ethereum
        *   Started off with SimpleID, universal ID that makes it easier so you don’t have to go through horrible MetaMask UX, they pivoted to something else
    *   For people who made simple apps and got $100k it’s great but where are they now?
*   And how should we do it going forward?
    *   Should be radically different
    *   Maybe it’s a selfish desire but the idea of funding apps is still a good idea
    *   I like the way some on chain voting goes - people make a proposal, it gets voted on and gets funded or not
    *   The downside is, if you look at a lot of these ecosystems they are still very buddy-buddy. Whoever knows the whales who can move the vote, etc.
    *   On the other hand, it seems better from the outside than what we had, where if you spend four hours rewriting the UI and now you have two note apps - you can get 2x the funding
    *   Our testing: we (NoteRiot, Webby, LandHo) opted out of App Mining at the end - because it was just noise
        *   Haven’t made any major changes to our app in ~7 mos because we are rewriting it
        *   NoteRiot - could use some updates
        *   There were months where we’d get a TryMyUI score of 82, the next month 37 - how does this make any sense? The scoring was off, the testing was off, the gaming was rampant
        *   Ideally there would be some funding mechanism to bring in apps that are high quality but there is no algorithm for this - it needs a person/people
        *   I would say that there is a minimum layer of privacy that needs to be built into the app - if you’re sending data to third parties the app should not qualify for consideration, if you’re using Google Analytics you’re not qualified - basic rules based on principle should be a gating mechanism
        *   Still a good idea if there’s some group making a decision, or at least some form of human reviewer(s).
*   What does governance mean to you?
    *   I’d turn this around to the working group
    *   Are we talking about community governance like Ubuntu community councils, development governance (e.g. Blockstack core), funding for App Mining, funding for the Foundation?
    *   Lots off different pieces
    *   Protocol changes, on-chain governance, etc.
    *   It means possibly all of those things or maybe one or two of them? Need to define the scope
*   What does _good_ governance mean to you?
    *   Fair
    *   Let’s define what governance we’re talking about first
    *   App funding: means there’s a rough consensus around which apps are getting funded
    *   Core dev: dev is focusing on features that community and developers/miners need
    *   Responsive 
    *   Kinda hard to nail down more than that
*   How do you get legitimacy/confidence/trust?
    *   Transparency
    *   Inclusiveness
        *   Q: How do we do this?
        *   Not all-encompassing
        *   I am less worried about the people who don’t have a stake - I think you need to have a stake in what you’re voting for
        *   Someone popped in to Xan’s AMA and said Blockstack is shit, STX is shit - let’s not allow that person to vote
        *   Need to have some stake in the game to have a voice
        *   a community should have a voice but not necessarily a vote
            *   concept of binding vs. non-binding vote
*   Where do we draw the line around Stakeholders?
    *   For those who don’t own STX, who aren’t miners, aren’t developers: non-binding voice
    *   Pooling is important, so people who are minorities can join together to make their voice heard
        *   some kind of delegation process, similar to what they just implemented in Clarity/STX 2.0, native delegation in protocol
    *   Does anyone NOT get even a voice?
        *   That’s a hard one, even harder
        *   Ideally every random person gets a voice but this may not be the reality
        *   I don’t think there’s an answer there
        *   Someone sent a meeting invite to the wrong person, she popped in, said “I don’t know who you are, what is this meeting about?”, but she shared her thought and made a good point then left - there’s value out there but hard to separate it from the crap
*   Is decentralization of governance the right goal? Why or why not?
    *   Decentralization in the actual mechanism - ideally in my perfect world we’d have a Linus Torvalds leading the thing - not decentralized but he generally aligns with my personal PoV so I like it - ideally have one person that I like
    *   I don’t want a committee, committees are terrible, I’d rather have a Benevolent Dictator for Life.
    *   But, who is that and how do you call yourself decentralized if you have one person dictating?
    *   Muneeb could be that person - there are things I wish he’d done more - I wish he’d been more available - we need people out there talking about this stuff more. He’s begun to do more of this in the past six months.
    *   Whoever that first director is, of the Foundation, I’d like Muneeb to be that person
    *   How do you put someone in that place, an Executive Director of the Foundation, that hasn’t spent a lot of time in the community, doesn’t have the background - I’d hate to see some random person like Tezos did, some random person in Switzerland - but also you have to pay that person
    *   Someone leading a company, with experience and expertise, if it’s a full time job you have to pay them
    *   I’m afraid if we leave it to them [PBC] they’ll pick a VC
*   How do we govern the Foundation? E.g. directors, to whom should it be accountable?
    *   Should have a strong leader, but should also be accountable to the community
    *   How do we vote someone in, how do we vote them out?
    *   Are there term limits?
    *   Rather than appointing a director for two years, how do we kick them out if they’re no longer acting in line with the will of the community?
    *   There should be an accountability piece - that’s fundamental
    *   I want to see how it gets structured first. How do decisions get made?
*   How have things worked in the past? What’s gone well/not so well?
    *   The reason you’re here is because PBC has been “the governance for everything"
    *   It’s been PBC decisions, whoever made them at the time
    *   No specific issues with PBC decisions - I’d just say that recently the complete focus on Stacks 2.0 and STX tokens coupled with a not-big-enough engineering team has meant that Blockstack has focused on parts of development that are speculative vs. stuff that we know the community wants like stable p2p radix, collections
    *   Talking Pure governance: on the dev side there are things we want other than Stacks 2.0
    *   I see Stacks 2.0  as hugely important but also less important than some of the foundational pieces that could’ve been there - I’m an investor but not in PBC and I’m not the one paying the developers so "I get it"
    *   We (developers) have asked for these things, but never said “we don’t want you to work on Stacks 2.0 we want you to work on radix” - “it’s on the back burner, we want community help on it"
*   How would you like things to work in the future?
    *   Nothing we haven’t talked about already
    *   I wish I had a better perspective, wish I knew every project and what’s working and what isn't
*   Who should have a role in protocol governance?
    *   One and the same with governance in general
    *   Even for protocol change you want miners, developers, user consensus
    *   Even if people are totally uninformed!
    *   Ideally we’d have a BDFL but that’s probably not gonna help us long term.
    *   It’s hard when you’re taking a public, VC-backed company and say “this is a public internet” - that’s a hugely difficult operation - it’s something I constantly go back and forth on. Do I really want a VC-owned internet? Hell no
    *   But we can set basic standards and use that money to do good things and start changing the conversation - privacy as default expectation - versus the assumption that I have to give all my info away
