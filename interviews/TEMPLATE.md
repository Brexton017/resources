# Stakeholder Interview Template

This is the template that was used for the interviews. Note that not every interview included every question.

- What’s your role in the project/community/ecosystem?
- How did you first get involved?
- What are the mission/vision/values of this community/project?
- What does governance mean to you?
- What does _good_ governance mean to you?
- How do you achieve legitimacy/confidence/trust in governance?
- Is decentralization of governance the right goal? Why or why not?
- Is this the right goal (i.e., decentralizing governance)?
- How has governance worked in the past?
- What’s gone well/not so well?
- How would you like things to work in the future?
- Where do we draw the line around stakeholders?
- Who should have a role in protocol governance?
- What are your thoughts on App Mining?
- How do we govern the Foundation? E.g. directors, to whom should it be accountable?
- What else should I have asked you?
