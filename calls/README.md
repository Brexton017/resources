# Community Calls

## Purpose

The governance working group will be hosting regular community calls to update the community about the progress of the project, and to give everyone a chance to have their voice heard. The first call was held on February 13, and future calls will be held every Wednesday at 7am PT/10am New York time (please reach out on Discord if you'd like to be added to the recurring email invitation).

## Who can Attend

Stacks governance is a community-run initiative! As such, it cannot work without your help, and without the input of as many community members as possible. _You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the initiative._ The #governance working group channel on [Blockstack Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ny6wGkx) is a great place to begin getting involved, as many community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [governance category](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/governance) on the Blockstack Community Forum which need your input.

## Agenda Items

You can find a link to the proposed agenda for the next call in the table below. The agenda for each meeting is saved as [an issue on Github](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues) under the stacksgov [project management repository](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm).

Please feel free to propose additions/amendments!
